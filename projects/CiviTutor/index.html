						<h3>The Problem</h3>
						<p>Immigrants currently make up over 13%* of the American population. Of this 13%, many will be seeking to go through the difficult and long process of naturalization, or obtaining citizenship. Citizen status is important to be able to vote, work, go to school, and obtain other benefits while living in the United States. Part of the naturalization process requires that applicants must demonstrate an ability to read, write, and speak in ordinary usage in the English language. This is reasonable for the majority of applicants, but there are certain immigrant groups that due to certain circumstances are not comfortable enough with the language to allow a valid interview in English. Those with disabilities or seniors that have legally resided in the States for a certain time frame are permitted to apply for an exemption from the English language requirement, but are still required to take the civics portion in their native language. </p> 

						<p>The problem is that many of the resources created to study for the civics test are also written in English, making it harder for those not familiar with the language to study. Currently, government web pages are a great resource in studying for the tests, and are even provided in several different languages. But while these sites are accurate and kept up to date, they can be hard to navigate and find the information that you are searching for. So despite the giant trove of facts, naturalization applicants still have a difficult time becoming familiar with the information required on the civics test. Therefore, the main idea for our solution is to create a holistic study application to help immigrants better learn the questions as well as facilitate a social study environment to practice with others.</p>
