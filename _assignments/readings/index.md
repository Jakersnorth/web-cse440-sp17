# Overview

Assigned readings are worth __5%__ of your overall course grade. 

We expect to assign approximately four readings over the length of the quarter.
Each assigned reading has a corresponding open-ended question that will be submitted and graded.
We have tried to set reading deadlines that give you the flexibility to read before or after the related lectures.
Do whichever is best for your personal learning style.

Responses are expected to be at most several paragraphs.
Their role is to get you engaged with and thinking about the material.
They will be graded according to whether they provide evidence you understood and considered the material in responding.

We will make additional resources available for students as interested.

# Assigned Readings

<a name="contextual_inquiry"></a>

### Reading 1: Empathy on the Edge

After reading, consider how you might apply this approach to your proposed project.

Submit a one page text reflecting on how you will establish empathy for the particular population that you chose to design for with two questions:

(1) What would be the ideal way of learning about the particular population that you chose to design for?

(2) What is a feasible way of learning about the particular population that you chose to design for?
